# Convolutional-Neural-Networks
Learn how to train our model to differentiate between dogs and cats using CNN.
o We start off with an input image.
o We apply filters or feature maps to the image, which gives us a convolutional layer.
o We then break up the linearity of that image using the rectifier function.
o The image becomes ready for the pooling step, the purpose of which is providing our convolutional neural network with the faculty of "spatial invariance".
o After we're done with pooling, we end up with a pooled feature map.
o We then flatten our pooled feature map before inserting into an artificial neural network.

o Throughout this entire process, the network's building blocks, like the weights and the feature maps, are trained and repeatedly altered in order for the network to reach the      optimal performance that will make it able to classify images and objects as accurately as possible.
